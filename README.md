# Advent of Code Solutions

Here I will post the solutions to all the problems I complete. Each year will have a little blurb explaining my goals, restrictions, etc.

## 2024

I'll be doing this one in Go. Trying again to complete all parts of all problems. We will see if I am able to complete this.

## 2023

As this is my first advent of code, I am setting myself some fairly easy goals (I hope). I do want to take the opportunity to get better at C/C++ so I'll be doing it in that.

### Goals

- Complete all problems and parts
- Complete problems within 48h of release

### Restrictions

- All even problems completed in C
- All odd problems completed in C++
- No looking up algorithms (documentation + language help is ok)
- No GPT or other AI
